This thesis presents two contributions to the analysis and quality
control of computational grammars of natural languages. We use
established techniques from software testing and formal methods, and
apply them to two different systems: Constraint Grammar, a robust and
low-level formalism for part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing,
and Grammatical Framework, a multilingual grammar formalism based on
deep structural analysis.
Firstly, we present a method for finding \emph{contradictory grammar rules} in
Constraint Grammar. Secondly, we generate \emph{minimal and
  representative test suites} of example sentences that cover all
grammatical constructions in Grammatical Framework.
