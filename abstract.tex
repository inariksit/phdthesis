Testing grammars has one big difference from testing software: natural language has no formal specification, 
so ultimately we must involve a human oracle. However, we can automate many useful subtasks: detect \emph{ambiguous constructions} and \emph{contradictory grammar rules}, as well as generate \emph{minimal and representative} set of examples that cover all the constructions. 
Think of the whole grammar as a haystack, and we suspect there are a few needles---we cannot promise automatic needle-removal, but instead we help the human oracle to narrow down the search.
