\section{Software testing and verification}
\label{sec:testing-intro} 


\begin{itemize}
\item All software has bugs.
\item Grammars are software.
\end{itemize}

An intelligent reader may complete the syllogism.

We can approach the elimination of bugs in two ways: find them by
catching concrete examples, or build safeguards into the program that
make it more difficult for bugs to occur in the first place.

Simplified model of programming languages: if it's easy to write
programs in a language, it's easy to write buggy programs. There are
languages that impose more checks and constraints, and thus make it
harder to write buggy code, but the overall effect is that it's harder
to write \emph{any} code. Some argue that the combination ``easy to
write correct code, hard to write buggy code'' exists, but the actual
language to achieve this varies from person to person.\footnote{There
  is more of a consensus of the existence of programming languages
  that are hard to write correct but easy to write buggy.} 

However interesting these points are from programming language
research point of view, they are way beside the point for this
thesis. We approach the problem from particular, existing grammar
formalisms that already have millions of lines of code written in
them. Thus, we want to develop methods that help finding bugs in
existing software. 

\subsection{Purpose of testing}

\begin{quote}
Level 0:  There is no difference between testing and debugging. \\
Level 1: The purpose of testing is to show correctness. \\
Level 2: The purpose of testing is to show that the software does not work. \\
Level 3: The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce the risk of using the software. \\
Level 4: Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop higher-quality software. \\

\todo{Maybe include the above classification and say what we want to do?}

\subsection{Testing}

You have a \emph{system}, you give it \emph{input} and 
\emph{expected output}.
Then you run the system with your input, and compare \emph{actual
  output} to expected output.

Some examples different types of tests:

\paragraph{Unit testing}

Write particular, concrete test cases: assume we want to test the
addition function (+), we could write some facts we know, such as
``1+2 should be 3''. In the context of grammars and natural language,
we could assert translation equivalence between a pair of strings,
e.g. ``\emph{la casa grande} $\Leftrightarrow$ \emph{the big house}'',
or between a tree and its linearisation, e.g. ``\t{DetCN the\_Det
  (AdjCN  big\_A house\_N)} $\Leftrightarrow$ \emph{the big house}''.
Whenever a program is changed or updated, the collection of unit tests
are run again, to make sure that the change has not broken something
that previously worked.

\paragraph{Property-based testing}

The weakness of unit testing is that it only tests cases that the
developer has thought of adding. Another approach is to use
property-based testing: the developer defines bstract properties that
should hold for all test cases, and uses random generation to supply
values. If we want to test the (+) function again, we could write a
property that says ``for all integers $x$ and $y$, $x+y$ should be
equal to $y+x$''. Then we generate 100 random pairs of integers, and
assert that all of them follow the property. 

Of course, the single property of commutativity is not enough to
define that (+) works as intended: if that were the only test, it
would happily pass any function with similar property,
e.g. multiplication, or some function $f(x, y) = 0$ for any $x$
and $y$. To remedy this, we would need to test other properties of
addition, or mix in some unit tests with specific values.

\subsection{Coverage criteria}

(Also from the same book)

\begin{itemize}
\item graph-based (e.g. node coverage)
\item logic-based (e.g. condition coverage)
\item input-space-based (e.g. input block coverage)
\item syntax-based (e.g. mutations)
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Symbolic evaluation \todo{what is this related to?}}

There are lots of things that can happen during the run of a
program. What happens if we get a 3 from the user as an input? Does it
crash if it's 29th of February and we get a 3 from the user?  Symbolic 
evaluation simulates the run of a program with different inputs, using 
a constraint solver to find out where certain combinations lead into.
