\chapter{Background}

In this chapter, we present the main areas of this thesis: computational natural language grammars and software testing.
Section~\ref{sec:cg-intro} introduces the CG formalism and some of the different variants, along with the historical context and related work.
For a description of any specific CG implementation, we direct the reader to the original source: CG-1 \cite{karlsson1990cgp,karlsson1995constraint}, CG-2 \cite{tapanainen1996}, VISL CG-3 \cite{bick2015,vislcg3}.
Section~\ref{sec:gf-intro} introduces the GF formalism \cite{ranta2011gfbook} and the Resource Grammar Library \cite{ranta2009rgl}.

Section~\ref{sec:testing-intro} is a brief and high-level introduction to software testing and verification, aimed to a reader with no prior knowledge on the topic. For a more thorough introduction on software testing in general, we recommend \todo{some book on testing}, and for SAT in particular, we recommend \cite{biere2009handbook}.

\section{Summary}

In this section, we have presented the theoretical background used in this thesis. 
We have introduced Constraint Grammar and Grammatical Framework as examples of computational grammars.
On the software testing side, we have presented key concepts such as unit testing and 
Boolean satisfiability. %: methods for solving whether a given propositional formula can evaluate to true.
In the following chapters, we will connect the two branches. Firstly, we encode CG grammars as SAT-problems, which allows us to apply symbolic evaluation and find potential conflicts between rules. 
Secondly, we use methods for creating minimal and representative test data, in order to find a set of trees that test a given GF grammar in an optimal way.
