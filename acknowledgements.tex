It's been fun and rewarding and tough and all kinds of
adjectives. %Actually I'm writing this in February, when it's still far from being over.
I don't think one ever feels finished, but for practical purposes, 5
years is a fairly good checkpoint.

Thanks to my supervisors Koen Claessen and Aarne Ranta. Who knew I
would find not just one but two answers to life, universe and
everything---I'm of course talking about SAT and fixpoint
computations.

Thanks to my colleagues at the department for making it fun to come to
work every day! My office mates Herb and Prasanth have shared with me
joys and frustrations (and dirty \LaTeX{} hacks), and helped me to
decipher supervisor comments. Outside my office, I want to thank
\todo{everyone} for all the fun things during the 5 years:
interesting lunch discussions, fermentation parties,
climbing, board games, forest excursions, playing music together,
sharing a houseboat, \dots

Thanks to all of my collaborators! The line between friendship and
coauthorship is blurry, but so is the line between life and
research. Thanks also to those who managed to write papers with me
without puking in my bed!

Något på svenska ja suomeks kanssa.
