\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{chp:acknowledgements}



% % It's been fun and rewarding and tough and all kinds of adjectives.  I
% % don't think one ever feels finished, but for practical purposes, 5
% % years is a fairly good checkpoint.

% % The first round of thanks goes to my supervisors Koen Claessen and
% % Aarne Ranta.  


% I am grateful to my supervisor Koen Claessen for his support and encouragement.
% % and
% Who knew I would find not just one but two answers to life, universe
% and everything---I'm of course talking about SAT and fixpoint
% computation.
% % In the beginning, we both had our separate bubbles of knowledge, and
% % this thesis was born out of combining them. 
% My co-supervisor Aarne Ranta is an equally important figure in my PhD
% journey, and a major reason I decided to pursue a PhD in the first
% place. 
% You two have been expert guides outside my comfort zone---I have felt
% that my language background is truly appreciated, meanwhile I have
% been learning more computer science

% Furthermore, I want to thank \todo{My eventual opponent/ grading
%   committee} for becoming my opponent/ grading
% committee, %, and providing feedback on the draft (if they do!)
% and Graham Kemp for being my examiner.


% I want to thank the whole GF community.
% % You are a major reason why I decided to pursue a PhD! 
% It all started back in 2010 when I was a master's student and joined a
% research project in Helsinki, led by Lauri Carlson. Lauri Alanko was
% most helpful office mate when I was learning GF, Kaarel Kaljurand was
% my first co-author and the Estonian resource grammar we wrote was my
% first large-scale GF project.  As important as it was to learn from
% others during my first steps, becoming a teacher myself has been even
% more enlightening. I am happy to have met and guided newer GF
% enthusiasts, especially Kristian Kankainen and Bruno Cuconato---I may
% have learned more from your questions than you from my answers!

% During my PhD studies, I've had the chance to collaborate with several
% people outside Gothenburg and my research group. I want to thank
% Eckhard Bick, Tino Didriksen and Francis Tyers for introducing me to
% CG and keeping up with my questions and weird ideas.  I am grateful to
% Jose Mari Arriola and Maxux Aranzabe for hosting my research visit in
% the Basque country and giving me a chance to work with the coolest
% language I've seen so far---eskerrik asko!

% Wen Kokke deserves a number of special thanks for being an awesome
% co-author (despite being part of a whole another grammar community and
% doing a PhD in a completely non-grammar-related area), for ..., and for everything else!

% On a more day-to-day basis, I want to thank all my colleagues at the
% department. My office mates Herb and Prasanth have shared with me joys
% and frustrations (and dirty \LaTeX{} hacks), and helped me to decipher
% supervisor comments. Outside my office, I want to thank Anders, Dan,
% Daniel, Elena, Irene, Gabriel, Guilhem, Simon H., Simon R. and Víctor
% for all the fun things during the 5 years: interesting lunch
% discussions, fermentation parties, hairdyeing parties, climbing, board
% games, forest excursions, playing music together, sharing a
% houseboat---just to name a few things. (Also it's handy to have a
% stack of your old theses in my office to use as an inspiration for
% writing acknowledgements!)

% Sometimes it's also fun to meet people outside research! I want to
% thank the wonderful people in Kulturkrock and Chalmers sångkör for
% making me feel at home in Sweden, not just in the small bubble of my
% research group. Ett extra tack till Anka och Jonatan för att ni rättat
% min svenska!

% Finally, 



% I could go on for quite a while, but since this thesis is all about
% grammars, let me express my gratitude in a way that only a grammarian can.
