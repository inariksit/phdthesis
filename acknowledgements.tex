It's been fun and rewarding and tough and great and all kinds of adjectives. Actually I'm writing this in February, when it's still far from being over.
I don't think one ever feels finished, but for practical purposes, 5 years is a fairly good checkpoint.

Thanks to my supervisors Koen Claessen and Aarne Ranta. Who knew I would find not just one but two answers to life, universe and everything---I'm of course talking about SAT and fixpoint computations.

Thanks to my colleagues at the department for making it fun to come to work every day! Thanks to my office (and boat) mates Herb and Prasanth for sharing joys and frustrations. Outside my office, I want to thank \todo{everyone} for all the fun things during the 5 years: fermentation parties, multilingual lunches, climbing, board games, forest excursions, coming to see my choir concerts, inviting me to your theatre shows, \dots

Thanks to all of my collaborators! The line between friendship and coauthorship is blurry, but so is the line between life and research. Thanks also to those who managed to write papers with me without puking in my bed!

Något på svenska ja suomeks kanssa.
